            We are a community oriented family church and we place great
            emphasis on love and connectivity to foster unity in worship. We are
            a praying church and we stand for sound doctrine. We place a high
            regard on creatives and because God is a creative with a great value
            for excellence, we strive for excellence to encapsulate a wholesome
            service and community. Our fellowship isnâ€™t complete without
            adequate worship and adoration, this is why we intentionally build a
            worship culture.{" "}
